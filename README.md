# BMI calculator

in this project we are going to write a python program to calculate the BMI


1. Measurements:
2. Weight(kgs)
Height(m)

BMI = Weight/(Height * Height)


we will use the BMI to determine whether the user is overweight, normal, or Underweight 

## Results:

If BMI > 24 then the person is overweight

If BMI is between 18 and 25 the person is Normal

If BMI <18 then the person is underweight
